    If you need to convert text from one markup format into another, pandoc is your swiss-army knife. Basically I wrapped [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) in a web service.

    Portable WiFi Hotspot with a chat

    You probably noticed that there is no internet connection in some very important places such as tube's tunnel or any lower ground floor.
    Why don't we create one? Perhaps it is not a real internet - but something else. The idea is to create WiFi hotspot with a chat and get to know who is around.
